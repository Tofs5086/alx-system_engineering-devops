when we talk about a simple web infrastructure, it contains many features but let's look at the componets of a simple web infrastructure
1. Server:
The central component that hosts all other elements.
Responsible for managing incoming requests, distributing them to the appropriate components, and handling responses.
Typically runs an operating system (e.g., Linux) and provides essential services like networking, security, and resource allocation.
2. Web Server (Nginx):
Nginx is a popular web server software.
Handles HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers).
Serves static content (e.g., HTML files, CSS, JavaScript, images) directly to users.
Acts as a reverse proxy, forwarding dynamic requests to the application server.
3. Application Server:
Executes server-side code to generate dynamic content.
Common choices include:
Python (e.g., using frameworks like Django or Flask)
Ruby (e.g., with Ruby on Rails)
Node.js (for JavaScript-based applications)
Communicates with the database and processes user input.
4. Application Files (Code Base):
Contains the actual application code.
Includes business logic, user authentication, data processing, and other functionality.
Developers write and maintain this codebase.
Deployed on the application server.
5. Database (MySQL):
Stores structured data for the application.
MySQL is a popular relational database management system (RDBMS).
Tables store information such as user profiles, game scores, and other relevant data.
The application server interacts with the database to read and write data.
6. Domain Name Configuration:
The domain name game.com is configured to point to the server’s IP address (in this case, 8.8.8.8).
The www subdomain is set up as a CNAME record (Canonical Name) that points to the root domain.
When users type a website such as  www.foobar.com in their browsers, DNS resolution directs them to the server’s IP address, allowing them to access the website.

Remember that this infrastructure model represents a simplified view. In practice, there may be additional components (such as load balancers, caching layers, and security measures) to enhance performance, scalability, and security.
